								<h2>Education: United States Naval Academy</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I studied <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> and <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> as a Midshipman at the Naval Academy from 2016 to 2020.<br /><br />
							During this time, I had the opportunity to serve in a variety of <strong>Leadership Roles</strong> and conduct a <strong>Year-long Research Project</strong> with three faculty advisers.<br /><br />
							I achieved a GPA of <strong>4.0</strong> while pursuing a double-major, and finished my career as a Midshipman ranked <strong>First in my class</strong> in academics.<br /><br />
							I was selected as one of nine <a href="https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/index.php"><strong>Trident Scholars</strong></a> for my class, and developed <strong>machine-learning models</strong> for <a href="https://www.usna.edu/TridentProgram/VirtualConference/Jellen.php"><strong>Near-Maritime Optical Turbulence</strong></a>.

							<p><strong>Data Analytics</strong>:<br />  <small>I had the opportunity to capture, develop, and investigate synchronized time-series data sets for environmental modeling, rapid structural prototyping, and image-based corrosion classification.<br />
							<strong>                </strong>I learned the importance of domain knowledge in data pre-processing, and a variety of approaches to handling missing data in large quantitative data sets.</small></p>
							<p><strong>Mechanical Engineering Design</strong>:<br />  <small>For my team Capstone design project, I applied rapid prototyping and computer aided design to develop a semi-autonomous fluid pipe inspection robot.<br /> 
							<strong>                               </strong>The project was entered into the <a href="http://www.usdasc.com/the-challenge"><strong>National Association of Corrosion Engineers 2019 Student Design Competition</strong></a>.  The USNA team which I lead placed <strong>first</strong> in the competition, successfully identifying and classifying all instances of corrosion within a steel fluid pipe.</small></p>
							<p><strong>Machine Learning Model Development</strong>:<br />  <small>I have experience in both regression and classification problems, trained on data sets which I developed individually or as part of a larger team.<br /> 
							<strong>                                    </strong>For my Capstone design project, I lead the effort to train and tune an image classifier for corrosion classification used on a semi-autonomous inspection robot. <br /> 
							<strong>                                    </strong>During my year-long Trident research project, I investigated non-parametric ensemble decision tree models and convolutional neural network models for quantitative optical turbulence prediction.  <br /> 
							<strong>                                    </strong>These models and associated findings were submitted to the <a href="https://discover.dtic.mil/"><strong>Defense Technical Information Center</strong></a>. and <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/home.cfm"><strong>Applied Optics</strong></a> journal, and are under peer-review for future publication as of May 2020.</small></p>

						<h2>Leadership</h2>
					</header>
					<p>During my career at the Naval Academy, I had the pleasure of serving in a variety of small and large unit leadership roles.<br /><br />
					The leadership education I received concurrently with my academic classes helped me to excel in managing small teams.<br /><br />
					I learned to appreciate the importance of understanding the strengths of each team member in order to maximize cohesion and effectiveness.<br /><br />
					Effective project management, team communication, and deliverable communication helped me develop and succeed as a leader in technical projects.<br /><br />
